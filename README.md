**Hey everyone,**  

I put together a small script that replaces the **Scheduled Restart Warnings** and **Announcement Notifications** in txAdmin. Just drop it into your `resources` folder and start it.  

⚠ **Important:** Make sure to enable the following settings in txAdmin:  
➡ **Settings → Game → Notifications**  
:white_check_mark: Enable **Hide Announcement Notifications**  
:white_check_mark: Enable **Hide Scheduled Restart Warnings**  

Otherwise, it won't work properly!

I wrote this for **QBCore** but you can easily modify it for **ESX** or even use it **Standalone**.
